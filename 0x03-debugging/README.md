# Debugging

In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.

## Learning Objectives
* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages

| File      | Description |
|-----------|-----|
| [0-main.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/0-main.c)     | Tests that the function ``positive_or_negative()`` gives the correct output when given a case of ``0`` |
| [1-main.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/1-main.c)     | Commented out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.  |
| [2-largest_number.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c)      | Fixed the code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.  |
| [3-print_remaining_days.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c)     | Fixed the function so that the output works correctly for __all_ dates and __all_ leap years.  |
| [main.h](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x03-debugging/main.h)     | The header file  |
