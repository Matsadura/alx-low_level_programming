# Enhancing Functionality: Exploring More Functions and Nested Loops in C

### Functions:
Functions in programming are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to modularize your code, making it more organized, readable, and reusable. Functions take input, process it using statements within the function body, and often produce output. In C, functions consist of a declaration, which defines the function's name, return type, and parameters, and a definition, which contains the actual code to be executed. Functions enable you to break down complex tasks into manageable pieces, enhancing code structure and maintainability.

### Nested Loops:
Nested loops involve placing one loop inside another. This structure allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code within the inner loop for each iteration of the outer loop. Nested loops are powerful for tackling tasks that require multiple levels of iteration, such as working with two-dimensional arrays or generating patterns. However, care must be taken to ensure efficient performance, as excessive nesting can lead to increased computational complexity. Understanding how to structure and control nested loops is essential for efficient problem-solving and algorithm design.

## Learning objectives 
* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include
