# Introduction to C Programming: Hello World and Core Concepts
## Summary:
This learning module introduces you to the exciting world of C programming. We'll explore the fundamental concepts that make C programming awesome, along with the key figures behind its development. From understanding the basics of compiling code to printing text and managing program structure, you'll build a strong foundation for your C programming journey. Dive into topics like the role of init files, variables, expansions, and more, as you learn how C has become one of the most influential programming languages.

## Learning Objectives:

* Discover the awesomeness of C programming and its significance in software development.
* Explore the pioneers behind C programming, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
* Understand the process triggered when you type "gcc main.c" and its implications.
* Learn about the entry point of a C program and the significance of the "main" function.
* Master text output using "printf," "puts," and "putchar."
* Utilize the "sizeof" operator to determine the size of data types.
* Compile C code using the "gcc" compiler and explore the default program name.
* Familiarize yourself with the official C coding style and verify your code using "betty-style."
* Find the correct headers for standard library functions in your source code.
* Grasp how the "main" function influences the program's return value.

| File      | Description |
|-----------|-----|
| [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)     | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.  |
| [1-compiler](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)     |  Compiles a C file but does not link.  |
| [2-assembler](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)      | Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.  |
| [3-name](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/3-name)     | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named ``cisfun``.  |
| [4-puts.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)     | Prints exactly ``"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle``, followed by a new line, using ``puts``.  |
| [5-printf.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)      | Prints exactly ``with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,``, followed by a new line, using ``printf``.  |
| [6-size.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)     | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.  |
| [100-intel](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)     | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.  |
| [101-quote.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)     | Prints exactly ``and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19``, followed by a new line, to the standard error, without using ``puts`` ``putchar`` or ``printf``.  |
