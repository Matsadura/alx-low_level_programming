# C Programming Fundamentals: Variables, Control Flow, and Loops

## Summary:
Embark on a journey into the core elements of C programming with this module. From grasping the intricacies of variables, arithmetic operations, and logical expressions to mastering control flow structures like "if" and "else" statements, as well as the power of loops, you'll lay a solid foundation for your C coding skills. By the end of this module, you'll be able to confidently manipulate variables, make decisions in your code, and create iterative processes that drive the functionality of your C programs.

## Learning Objectives:

* Learn how to utilize arithmetic operators for numerical computations.
* Explore logical operators and their role in creating boolean expressions.
* Understand relational operators and how they enable comparisons between values.
* Grasp the concepts of TRUE and FALSE values in C programming.
* Master boolean operators and their application in decision-making.
* Acquire proficiency in using "if" and "if...else" statements for conditional execution.
* Discover the importance of comments in enhancing code readability.
* Gain the ability to declare variables of char, int, and unsigned int types.
* Learn the art of variable assignment and manipulation.
* Understand how to utilize "printf" to print variable values effectively.
* Explore the mechanics of the "while" loop for creating iterative processes.
* Master the integration of variables within the "while" loop.
* Learn how to print variable values using the "printf" function.
* Understand the significance of the ASCII character set in character representation.
* Explore the purposes of the gcc flags "-m32" and "-m64" in compiling code for different architectures.

| [0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)     | Assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable ``n`` is positive or negative.  |
| [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)      | Assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable ``n``.  |
| [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)     | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using ``putchar``.  |
| [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)     | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using ``putchar``. |
| [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)      | Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except ``q`` and ``e`` using ``putchar``.  |
| [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)     | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from ``0``, followed by a new line.  |
| [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)     | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, without using any variable of type ``char`` and only using ``putchar`` twice.  |
| [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)     | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using only ``putchar`` twice.  |
| [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)      | Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line using only ``putchar`` three times.  |
| [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)      | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, numbers are separated by ``,`` followed by a space in ascending order, without using any variable of type ``char`` and only using ``putchar`` four times.  |
| [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)       | Prints all possible different combinations of two digits, numbers are separated by ``,`` followed by a space in ascending order, without using any variable of type ``char`` and only using ``putchar`` five times, ``01`` and ``10`` are considered the same combination of the two digits ``0`` and ``1``.   |
| [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)      | Prints all possible different combinations of three digits, numbers are separated by ``,`` followed by a space in ascending order, without using any variable of type ``char`` and only using ``putchar`` six times, ``012``, ``120``, ``102``, ``021``, ``201``, ``210`` are considered the same combination of the three digits ``0``, ``1`` and ``2``.  |
