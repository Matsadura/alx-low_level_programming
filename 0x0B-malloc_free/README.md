# Dynamic Memory Management: Malloc and Free
Malloc and free are essential functions in C programming for managing memory dynamically. Malloc is used to allocate memory during runtime, allowing for flexible data storage, while free is used to release memory once it's no longer needed. 
## Learning Objectives
* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is ``malloc`` and ``free`` and how to use them
* Why and when use ``malloc``
* How to use ``valgrind`` to check for memory leak

| ----------- | ----------- |
| [0-create_array.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/0-create_array.c) | Creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. |
| [1-strdup.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/1-strdup.c) | Returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. |
| [2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/2-str_concat.c) | Concatenates two strings.  |
| [3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c) | Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers. |
| [4-free_grid.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/4-free_grid.c) | Frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by ``alloc_grid`` function. |
| [100-argstostr.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/100-argstostr.c) | Concatenates all the arguments of the program. |
| [101-strtow.c](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/101-strtow.c) | Splits a string into words. |
| [main.h](https://github.com/Matsadura/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0B-malloc_free/main.h) | The header file. |
